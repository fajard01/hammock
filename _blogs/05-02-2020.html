    Hi from Peru, which needs to be specified because we just took a very thrilling and spontaneous detour..... <br><br>

    Yeahh so we were meant to sort out our passports a few weeks back, but laziness, too much queuing and a lack of desire for more queuing meant we left it a bit late. <br><br>By the time we finally sorted everything and had wasted another full day
    in
    queues, they told us we'd overstated our visas and had to cross the border and re-enter Peru. <br><br><em>Grrrrr.</em><br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Our original idea was always to head to Bolivia from lake titicaca in a desire to retrace the steps of the Holy Trinity (Jezza James and Richard *), but then around November things started fucking up with their military coup and political
    protests which resulted in a closed border. <br><br>Heard all sorts of stories about tourists being denied entry or just making it out of the country in time, so we slowly resigned ourselves to the fact that Bolivia may have to wait for a few
    years. <br><br><br>Then
    out of the blue, everything was ok again, people were heading to la paz and we needed to cross the border! Could there be a clearer sign? <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    We had the flat for a couple more days after the trek, so booked our bus to la paz in the afternoon, packed up all our shit <em>(god we bought a lot of clothes at baratios)</em> and suddenly were on our way over the border. <br><br> After months
    of comfort and
    staying in the same place, there was a sudden new thrill of adventure in spontaneously heading to la paz, about a day after considering the idea, just the two of us somewhere new with different money and <strong>NO GUIDE BOOK</strong>. <br><br>I
    was supremely disoriented
    and stressed when we first pulled into la paz, mostly because we had no cash, no Lonely Planet <em>(never going anywhere without one again, they're brilliant)</em>, not even a map of the city and the compass was too deep in the backpack.
    <br><br>The huge
    backpacks caused another issue, branding us as wealthy tourists and sorely inhibiting our ability to run if needed. We've had absolutely zero scrapes or dodgy situations in 3.5 months in Peru, but barely an hour after we arrived in la paz I
    somehow misplaced my wallet and ended up having to buy three juices for thugs in balaclavas to get it back. <br><br>We were both a bit shaken after this, but the worst bit was those were 7 boliviano juices which we wanted to drink ourselves!!
    <br><br>
    Absolute
    robbage.
    <br><br>
    However, once G had taken charge of the wallet because M is no longer trustworthy and we settled we began to really appreciate la paz as a city - immediately jumped on the loop of cable cars that glides over the metropolis like an army of angels,
    affording the most arresting views of a sprawling city draped into the valley and over the hills of the Andean altiplano. <br><br>As we rose up the city just kept <strong>GOING</strong>, rising taller than lima with it's glossy skyscrapers yet
    retaining that
    Peruvian
    barebricked look, all to a backdrop of mountains. <br><br>As evening rolled in the clouds rolled out to reveal Illimani, the jawdropping iced titan that stands sentinel over the city.

    We were pleasantly surprised by the comfort and wealth of la paz - Bolivia is reportedly the second poorest country in South america, but this isn't really evident from it's de facto capital. <br><br>The lack of a coast (stolen by Chile in the
    1800s) has
    certainly harmed the country, but trade with Peru has ensured the apparent prosperity of this region. There was absolutely no sign of the recent political upheaval, which came as a complete surprise. It carries many similarities with what we know
    of Peru - barebricked houses, expansive street markets, traditionally dressed women dragging around alpacas - so we felt quite at home, though this time with added bread because Peruvian bread sucks and is just Sweet Air and somehow the ability
    to bake never made it over lake titicaca. <br><br>We made it our mission on our first night to try as much new street food as would fit, which depressingly was not as much as we would've liked :( <br><br>

    We enjoyed a day of trawling the endless markets of la paz, a city made of markets that crowd every street, until needing to take a break in the gorgeous concrete cemetery slightly marred by the piles of empty coffins and frequent eviction
    notices on graves.

    But the real highlight of coming to Bolivia was after a night bus down to Uyuni (a bizarrely pale and open town that sports the best slide this side of the Atlantic) (also seesaws) when we boarded a 4x4 for a three day trip to
    the altiplano. <br><br>
    <em>Wooop!</em><br><br>

    After a quick stop at the train cemetery, a mess of rusted iron carcasses, we began to approach the immense flat expanse that is the Salar de Uyuni.

    The world's biggest salt flats spreading over 10,000 sqkm on the Bolivian altiplano, the
    entire
    surface is so remarkably flat and blinding white it really is like entering a completely different planet. <br><br>I felt like I was walking on Hoth, or the salt planet from episode VIII, because in every direction there is only horizon, pale
    blue of
    the
    clear sky marrying a white so brilliant it looks ethereal. <br><br>Should probably have kept the sunglasses on, but I couldn't resist facing the Blinding brightness full on, just as we couldn't resist liberating our feet to feel the crunch and
    the
    crystals beneath our soles. <br><br><em>(Also we ate a LOT of salt)</em>
    <br><br>
    There were completely dry patches where the perfect hexagonal structure tiled the surface, but for the first time we were actually lucky to be visiting during rainy season because the thin layer of water transforms the Salar into the world's
    largest mirror, a perfect reflection of the wet sky stained by the setting sun. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    The next two days we drove over huge flat desert expanses, punctured by smooth snowy peaks and prehistoric rock formations, mirror lakes spotted by countless flamingos (not as pink as expected, but just as cool) and so much more wildlife:
    <br><br>
    vicu√±as
    (the rarer supermodel version of the llama), <br>suris (vertically challeneged ostriches), <br>viscachas (inbred backwoods cousin of the chinhilla), <br>everything. <br><br>We began the day in burning sunlight and finished in wild lightning
    storms illuminating
    the
    Siloli Desert in a fantasmagoric display of heavenly power, cruising across the flatness in a tiny metal tin. <br><br>

    The Laguna Colorada looked rather less coloured under the angry clouds, th40gh returning the next day afforded us perfectly serene views of the rosy pink waters, overwatched by its own volcano sentinel. <br><br>And again, so many flamingos!!!!
