    <strong>Gemma and mereida go Shopping - a camping trip - new year - the day i saw god - a camping Trip - the fourth lake - copyright infringement
      Bonjour and welcome to 2020!</strong> <br><br> Yes I know this is late, but we've been busy and active and got a lot to tell! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    We heralded in the new year with a camping trip to Lares, though it being rainy season and the middle of the Andes we were warned harshly against the cold. <br><br> We had to delay the trip so we could pop to Barratios, the enormous weekly
    clothes market and Gemmas wet dream. Every Saturday, a whole barrio of nondescript streets explodes into a maze of second hand clothes, tools, food, shoes, pipes, llama heads, all your everyday needs. But G got a bit frustrated because
    she wanted
    to buy everything,
    and
    I got a bi5 frustrated because I can't handle so much shopping... <br><br> Anyway, a few hours and hundreds of soles later, we were all kitted out in puffy jackets, jumpers and workmans gloves for a thoroughly cold camping trip! <br><br>

    Plans change, though, and we ended up heading to the thermal baths <em>(popular peruvian pasttime that should be adopted by britain)</em> nestled deep in a strikingly tropical valley a queasy combi ride from Cusco.

    Had a bit of a hike but the main
    attraction
    was certainly the boiling natural baths which it was a challenge to liberate ourselves from, despite boiling long enough to be served up for Christmas. Such luxury! <br><br> We sizzled and broiled for much longer than is medically advisable, and
    once
    night
    drew up the valley, climbed the side of the mountain to battle the thin air into making a fire. <br><br> Suffice to say by the time we wriggle into the tiny tent we were very very very warm and all them fluffy clothes no longer came in handy.
    <em>(I
      had such
      a
      hot night I had to jump into the mountain stream the next morning before our final soak, to get those prickles like rolling on Lego bricks that come from full body chilblains)</em>

      Heat was good but may have messed up Max's stomach, who was therefore out of action for new years.

    I went alone with Chris and Mitch to a teacher party which for me involved less alcohol than Christmas but that didn't hold back Mitch and Toby who
    didn't even make it to 2020, opting instead for a comfy nap/complete-passage-out on each other. <br><br> Great choice of flatmates, Chris. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    The three of us had a few days of being tourists in cusco, which was nice until my brush with god: so we were just chilling in the <em>Church With All The Mirrors</em> when mass started and we wanted to sit and listen to the nuns choir
    <em>(think sister act
      pre-dolores, or is that too mean?)</em> when the priest came in and started being all holy and all of a sudden the world literally started to spin as if it jumped on a roundabout, the buzzing of an orchestra of bees rose up in my ears and my
    vision
    began
    to white out. <br><br> We have sat through a lot of holy mass in this country, so what the fuck ?! <br><br> I really wanted to stay and listen but every organ in my body was violently battling that desire, the floor was shifting beneath me and
    all o could see was
    blinding white. <br><br> I had to leg it out of church barely 10 minutes into the service and recover outside from my brush with god, who later punished me for running away by serving me an allergic reaction to something milky. <br><br> Very
    bizarre day, to say
    the
    least... <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    At the weekend we went camping again, this time with two of C's friends to Kinsacocha <em>(quechua for three lakes, though would more aptly have been named four lakes)</em> for a very different <em>(and far less cosy)</em> kind of trip.

    The walk up was
    hard,
    carrying
    tents and food and water <em>(It felt like someone robbed us of all the breath in our lungs)</em> but we were rewarded by gorgeous views of the sparse, llama speckled mountains and serene lakes, choosing to pitch camp at the top of a pass
    overlooking lake
    number two (ishkay in quechua) at the true mercy of nature.

      In the evening sun, we headed up to the third lake for an ice cold dip, and G and I had quite the laugh watching the skinny boys panic their way into the clear icy water.
    </div>

  <div class="blog">
    The
    cold was
    welcome at first, even after we failed <em>(though not for lack of trying)</em> to raise a flame to the wood we dragged all the way up the mountain <em>(poor fire looked just how I'd felt traipsing up that path, though it didn't do us the honours
      of actually
      lighting)</em>. <br><br>

    Once it darkened and clouded over, everyone wriggled into their sleeping bags and got real cosy, and I was juuuuuust thinking to myself how soothing the patter of rain on the tent sounded when there was a <em>SCREAM</em> and Sheyla leapt
    up to reveal the
    collecting puddle of water at the bottom of the tent ! <br><br> Suffice to say I will never forget the meaning of the word <em>'mojado'</em> (wet). <br><br> The water was seeping in through the base to form the fourth lake of the mountain right
    inside our
    tent, and from
    that
    point on no one would ever be comfortable, or dry, or warm, again. We did everything in our power to hold off the wet, lying on bags and coats and each other, but the key really was to give in to the elements and not move because each time you
    moved
    you just felt wetter. <br><br> And colder. <br><br> Unzipping the tent to find it surrounded by ice certainly did nothing for morale, but I suppose that's what you get for going camping during rainy season at 4 and a half thousand metres up.

    <hr><br><br>

    The night was sleepless and uncomfortable but all in all we survived and had an adventure for sure. <br><br> Was a relief like no other to arrive back in cusco and get warm and dry, and I love a good view over mountains but the view from the
    comfort of
    C's
    enormous bed over Cusco is unbeatable. <br><br> Their flat has a perfect location - 20 mins from the plaza, at the relevant end of town with a smashing view. <br><br> Only problem: on top of a hill! <br><br> Enter: The Batman, saviour bus and
    most blatant example of
    copyright
    infringement. <br><br> There's nothing like spending a day down in cusco and jumping on the Batman back home which stops right in front of our door, doing all the hard work back up the hill. And it's covered in bat symbols!
