    Oi oi, we're back and fresh (or not so fresh considering all the mould) from a month in the Amazon Rainforest!

    We hope you've missed us dearly, meanwhile we've learnt what it means to miss a great deal of stuff: <br><br> drinkable tap water,
    drinkable any
    water, sun that sets after 6pm, refrigeration as a concept, cockroach free kitchens, going outside without offering yourself as a sacrifice to the Nourishment of the Mosquito Hordes, <br><br> ya get the picture. <br><br>

    Irregardless though - living in the jungle is incredible. <br><br> You wake in the morning to the first rays of sunlight tickling the treetops (because the walls of the house are not made of wall but of mosquito net - there are but two layers of
    holey
    fabric
    between our sleeping bodies and the fancies of the jungle) and filtering through layers of canopy.

      Though, that is if at first you haven't already been roused by the war-cry of the monster rooster, a small velociraptor running round his own
      Jurassic
      Park. <br><br> He's fucking massive, and scarier than any creature the jungle could throw at us.

    The tapestry of sound ebbs and flows with daylight - insects, birds, wind in the branches, rain, monkeys, so much more you can't identify.
    <br><br>
    At night, when all
    you
    see is that which is illuminated by the candle, the chirping and buzzing crescendoes until you fell like you're sitting in a room surrounded by a thousand static TVs. <br><br>Then morning rolls around again and you're spotting birds from the
    breakfast
    table
    or watching wee transparent lizards scuttle across the walls like the most nature friendly computer screensaver.

    We live in this big old wooden house that's falling apart, slap bang in the middle of the forest.

    Everything is so <em>greeeeeen</em>, leaves the size of paddling pools, any other colour practically forbidden unless provided by a butterfly (which there
    are
    infinitely many of). <br><br> We had the massive house to ourselves for the first week or so, which meant lots and lots of Naked Time because it was just the perfect temperature to be frolicking unclothed. <br><br>This was probably a mistake to
    do
    outside judging
    by
    the constellations of mosquito bites that amassed as we gradually got eaten alive, yet we could not resist the forest.
    <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    But there was no rain! <br><br> Felt a bit cheated to be completely honest, you come to the rainforest and it can't even live up to its name. <br><br> It got a bit critical since we had very little drinking water so i composed a lil poem:
    <br><br>

    <cite>
      Where is the rain? <br>
      They cried in vain <br>
      For the heavens were dry as dust <br><br>

      But wait they must <br>
      For the clouds to bust <br>
      And the sky to cry again <br><br>
    </cite>

    And lo behold! <br>We got rain. <br><br> <em>Raaain</em>. <br><br>The downpour was like the feeling when you finally piss after holding in your bladder for too long. We immediately rain outside butt naked for what is undisputedly the best
    shower in the world. Standing with
    your
    face turned to the heavy sky in the middle of the forest, its green refreshed like a lick of new paint, surrounded by mighty trees bowing with the weight of the rain around you as the water streams all over you body. <br><br>It was not the last
    of it's
    kind,
    but that first shower, after days of sweat and grime, was a cathartic cleanse of the soul as much as our our skin.

    Water situation was kinda funky: when it was hot we bucket showered at the well (watched by our guardian angel the football sized toad), collected rainwater for dishes and sometimes filtered to drink, if we couldn't be bothered to fetch drinking
    water from the magic pipe in the jungle. <br><br>There's a certain primal thrill to the idea of 'fetching water', a hark back to simpler days of physical toil, which doesn't quite translate to tramping through the jungle for half an hour with
    25kg on
    your
    back and falling into streams of water along the way.

      Aside from the mosquitos, we've played host to a small army of cockroaches in the house (small may be the wrong word - some of these fuckers are the size of a newborn kitten, though rather less photogenic).

    The hammer has been put to more use as
    a
    Certified Cockroach Killer than it ever was for bashing nails into the wall, but they follow the trend or weeds and Kelly Clarkson: Destroying them just makes them multiply. <br><br> I've never been able to sleep if i need to pee, but the terror
    of going
    to
    the loo at night in a stall riddled with cockroaches was enough to train my bladder into submission. Suppose that's something... <br><br>

    Got lots more to tell of the jungle but ciao for now! <br><br>
