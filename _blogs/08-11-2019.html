    Hi! <br> Some news that isn't election related. It's been a while but we're back in Lima and sufficiently rehydrated. <br> This might be a long one...

  Yes we finally made it out of lima to see some of the country, and also to see some greeeeen again. Plants! We established on our first day in Tupac that the one tree outside the shopping centre is so coated in dust I had to lick it in order to get
  to the green bit, so were relieved to be surrounded by vegetation that isn't suffocating.

  Spent the last week with J, busing it down through the mountains from Jaén in the Amazonas region where the Andes meet the rainforest resulting in spectacular mountain vistas, our first taste of jungle and some extreme roads. Wobbly bobbly, as
  gemma
  put it.

  Our first couple of nights we slept in a teeny mountain village above Chachapoyas sitting most of the way up a cliffside. Aside from eating entirely too much banana (the main crop there) and suffering the resulting digestive fallout, it was so
  refreshing to be out in the forest, seeing the mountains on the way to the loo and watching the stars while sitting on it. There were hummingbirds in every bush, and more chickens than humans except the chickens here look like velociraptors
  attending
  a 70s wig party. They be funky. From the village we trekked through the rainforest soundtracked by birds and frogs to Catarata de Gocta, a ridiculously enormous waterfall that is so ridiculously big the water isn't even liquid by the time it hits
  the
  rock below. And that's only the top half of the falls! It felt good to stretch our legs after spending a lot of time in buses and tricycles, climbing up and down and deeper into Jurassic park. Rainforest did begin to live up to its name though, and
  by the afternoon I had to fashion myself a rain coverage with plastic bags while G just got drenched, like a real Indiana Jones thank you very much. We were accompanied by a chorus of frogs that were so goddamn close the entire time but Did Not See
  A
  single One. There were thousands. Thousands! (-G). But yes. Incessant rain. There's a reason these are called the cloud forests.

  Next we visited Kuélap, our first proper archaeological site perched quite literally on the top of a 3000m mountain. Built around 700AD by the Chachapoyas, a pre-incan warrior civilisation, it's incredibly well fortified by a 20m wall and so high
  up
  we got a cable car to reach it. The wall only has three entrances, so narrow they forced any invading groups into single file lines (!) and now keep the automatic lawnmowers (resident alpacas) from making a break for it. The site is super cool and
  well preserved, but honestly we were just so blown away by how beautifully overgrown it is now, twisted up in the roots of trees and draped in lianas, that it was kinda difficult to take notice of the myriad round stone structures (around 400?).
  Coupled with the endless mountains of farmland and forest stretching out into the clouds (how I do love to be on the tallest mountain) and I felt like those early astronauts discovering earth from space: travelling so far to marvel at the
  achievements of ancient man, only to be bowled by the beauty of nature.

  We got to see our mummies in Leymebamba, except these ones were dead and less pretty than our mothers (<) but still had enough leathery skin to look freakishly human. Most of them remained wrapped up and frustratingly far behind glass but close
    enough to give us a chilling drawing experience nevertheless. The longer we stared into their eyeholes, the more fucking creepy they became and by the end we were very very glad that most of the 200 mummies couldn't look at us like that. There
    was even a baby with it's foot under it's chin that was actually so cute I wanted to take it home and cuddle it (-G). From Leymebamba begins The Day of Many Transports, 11 in total not counting all the walking, which there was also a lot of. But
    yes in one day we took: The night coach arriving in Cajamarca which was admittedly really really comfy and also managed to not throw us into the aisle despite us hitting some really long and winding mountain roads. And also had some jazzy music,
    that somehow never got bad Combi (mini tricycle) to the hot baths which the Inca bathed in before getting roundly defeated by the Spanish, and which finally satisfied G's bath craving and proved her to be the child of not one but two lobsters who
    can get into EXTreMely hot water (I just got boiled alive) Chama (public bus made put of a converted minibus, not the safest mode of transport but by far our favourite). Chama chama chama chameleeeeeeeeoooooooon Another combi that I'm convinced
    the driver didn't know where he was going Minibus to San Pablo that nearly left Justino behind because we didn't know how to say 'a passenger is missing' in spanish (we do now) and because he was getting food Motokar (bigger tricycle that
    subjects your entire body to every tiny pinhead in the road) to Kuntur Wasi Police car back from the site, because G the magpie attempted to steal all the gold (no it was just because there was nothing else driving the road, and a highly
    enjoyable ride it was in which the two policemen capitalised on our englishness by just repeatedly shouting 'Manchester!' Or 'liverpool!' Because Football Is The Universal Language (that I don't speak.........) Taxi down the mountain on a
    rollercoaster road Doubledecker coach halfway to Trujillo but that would've gone all the way to Lima so we weren't allowed to sleep because J just wanted to go home to work and party and whatever else is so important in Lima Minibus coach thing
    to Trujillo Taxi to the hostel. Phewwwwwwwwww. -->
