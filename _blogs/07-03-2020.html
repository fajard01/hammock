    <strong><em>Holaaaa</em>, it's been a few weeks so gotta play catch up, we've left lima and returned all in this time. </strong>
    <br><br>
    Yes after a few months away we finally made it back to lima, back to Tupac which welcomed us with open arms and a showering of 1 sol sandwiches (so what if the main cause of our lima excitement is cheap food). <br><br>Immediately we were happy,
    not just
    to
    be home and dump all the heavy shit that's been accumulating in our backpacks like a glacial moraine (?) but because it's <em>SUMMER!!</em> <br><br>My impression of lima in October was one of perpetual greyness, not a heavy grey pile
    London but just this
    vast
    open
    flatness like a persistent layer of dust. <br><br>But my oh my, the sun really does the city some favours, flip flops and marcianos <em>(ice lollies)</em> out in full force, so we hit the beach straight away with J to try his new hobby -
    windsurfing.
    <br><br>Yep,
    he's
    bought
    a board and is getting lessons on the chorrillos beachfront, which is great except he gets to learn on an easy board while we had to struggle along on his much more difficult pro board which weighs about as much as a whole Peruvian family on a
    motorbike. <br><br>Couldn't even lift the damn sail the first time, but we did improve markedly despite attracting the interest of a myriad jellyfish big enough to wear as a helmet, and now we can <em>(kinda kinda)</em> windsurf! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Would've been sad to leave the sun and beaches of lima had we not been going north for more of the same, cruising down the coast picking up monster tans and a platano chip addiction <em>(crisps made of fried banana - heaven)</em> along the way.
    <br><br>Yes we
    finally
    finally made it up to Tumbes, a plan we'd had pretty much since arriving in Peru but that never quite materialised.

    I mean it is right at the top end of the country, 25 mins from Ecuador, and our desire to see this rather untouristy of
    destinations
    was based almost solely on the Tumbes Crocodile, predictably depicted on a coin...... <br><br>Had a nice relaxed time in the heat of the north, the air dripping in humidity like the trees that drip with flowers. There is a determined beauty to
    the grime
    of
    the town, sweaty and packed without ever being claustrophobic, aided by the kitch mosaics that bulge from many walls. <em>(3D relief mosaics! What an idea!)</em> My favourite detail by far has to be the big mosaic mural display at the head of the
    plaza,
    flanked by a huge broadband billboard advertising Tumbes and showing in the photo, you guessed it, that very same display. <br><br> Like seeing double but just more stupid.

    From here we went on the nicest, loveliest tour, with an agency run by this family and the whole family baby and all accompanied us on this trip <em>(dad guide and baby holder; mum driver; son the muscle; baby cute distraction)</em>. We ended up
    feeling
    like
    we'd gotten to tag along on the Sunday family outing, involving fruit picking, mud bathing and hunting for fossilized wood in the Jurassic park of Cerro Amotape, which even comes with its own pterodactyls!

    Or anyway they really looked
    like
    pterodactyls, not sure the Peruvian government has actually succeeded in bringing them back to life. <br><br>
    From there it was on to Mancora, beach capital of Peru or 'home of the hangover' as it may better be called. <br><br>We checked in to a beach resort hostel for the party and the pool, receiving neither as it turned out to be pretty lowkey and WE
    WERENT
    ALLOWED IN THE POOL AT NIGHT. <br><br>Absolute travesty. <br><br>But we hit the bar regardless and it turned into a really fun night dancing with other tourists and locals, and we were rather relieved to have a chill hostel to return to and a
    pool to
    swim off
    the
    hangover in the morning. In fact, I don't think we made it out of the pool before midday, at which point we gently transferred ourselves to the beach 10m away to be repeatedly pummelled by the ocean. <br><br>Mancora is famous for its waves,
    smooth
    rolling
    sea monsters cruising along its endless beach, which might provide easy surfing but dealt us a real workout in trying to stay afloat. Nothing like a repetitive slap in the face from a wave, like the most sadistic metronome, to clear a hangover.
    <br><br>

    The subsequent night and day followed the same pattern, though we upped our game by trying to learn to flip into the pool <em>(Not Recommended For The Cripplingly Hungover)</em> leaving me with a smattering of bruises down my back. <br><br> And
    finally,
    on our
    last
    evening we managed to slip in a nighttime swim in the inky Pacific, occasionally being consumed by waves that crept up on us in the darkness, only noticing them if they crested like a white crown glinting in the night. <br><br>These waves gave us
    our
    best
    gift yet - bioluminescense, drifting like grains of glitter on the sea foam, coalescing into shadows of light behind your hand passing through the water. A perfect goodbye from the ocean. <br><br>

    We night bussed it to Chiclayo, our final stop before heading inland to iquitos where we only planned to spend one day but we didn't read the guidebook closely enough - museums here are closed on Mondays! So a day turned into two, giving us the
    chance to crash and unfurl before our archaeological tour to the best fucking museum in Peru. <br><br>The Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipan is a relatively new addition to the Peruvian museum roster, but a valuable one: collecting the wealth from
    Moche tumbas
    <em>(tombs)</em> that remained completely unraided until their discovery in the 80s, meaning for once you get to see all the gold and craftsmanship that escaped the looting of locals and the rampant melting the Spanish so loved to indulge.
    <br><br>Gemma
    the
    magpie
    was transported to seventh heaven, but even I learned to appreciate the allure of gold in these exquisitely crafted forms, jewellery and armour, headdresses and tools, decorated with precious stones and carvings and embossing, all tucked away
    with
    buried kings and protected in their soil prisons from prying fingers. <br><br>A tiny glimpse into the vast ancient wealth of just one of Peru's countless civilisations, a tantalising taste of what was, and what was destroyed. <br><br>

    Alright, enough for now, next time we head back into the amazon for some monkey business.... <br><br>

    Byeeeeeee! <br><br>
