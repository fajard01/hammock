    <strong>Hello from Peru! </strong><br><br>
    It's Sunday and we've been here two weeks! Haven't noticed the days go by as we float from place to place, meal to meal, just enjoying the views.

    It is a different life here as J keeps pointing out, but not one we took much getting used to. <br><br>
    We're living on top of this ground-floor-shopping-centre-mini-arcade-thing (J is into 'microbusinesses') meaning there's always people downstairs selling and buying and fixing and working.<br><br> Also hammering. Too mich hammering.
    <br><br>Justino built
    the house several stories up though, and despite the bustle beneath our floor is wide open and very comfortable and hAS A DANCEFLOOR. <br><br>Yes life is complete G and I have ourselves our very own ballroom and have already baffled and amused
    the
    men of the
    house with our incessant dancing. <br><br><em>Nos encanta bailar!</em>
    <br><br>
    <em>( the only difficult thing that I don't think I can become accustomed to is the lack of drinkable tap water, <br>and worse the lack of ANY water when it sometimes runs out in the evening. <br>Never in my life have I been so thrilled about
      clean socks and a shower the morning after a waterless night )

    Getting to know Tupac is fun; already got the feeling of "ahh, how nice to be home" after a long days of inner city and lima buses <em>(almost as bad as the jubilee line - but not quite)</em>.

    We return to food on the table courtesy of our housewife
    Estik, G's quarter brother - they share the same half sister - with whom much Spanish is also practised. <br><br> He does have a tendency to misunderstand so we come across as total blasphemous lunatics <em>(the mad dancing doesn't help)</em>,
    but
    considering I
    have been learning Spanish for six weeks, and G hasn't done it since year 9, we get by decently.

    But Tupac is comfortable. <br><br>The madness begins when you consider J's parents bought this place 40, 50 years ago and it was on the edge of Lima. <br><br>Beyond Tupac the farmlands started, but now we climb the turret on the 5th floor and
    there is
    just
    city, sprawling, stretching, melting into the mist. <br><br> An ocean of dust with no horizon in every direction, it's waves crested with little Jesuses surfing the masses below. <br>Poring over maps one may think Lima has almost the same size as
    London,
    but it is <br><br>
    So. Much. Bigger.

      The new revelation was the view from the roof of J's other flat in chorrillos, which we've been helping do up.

    The flat is on the top floor with a ladder that leads up to the tallest roof around, and nothing compares to the exhilaration of
    standing
    above this mess of a city, wind in hair, in arms reach of the swooping birds of prey that swirl like guardian angels watching over lima. <br> <br>It feels both calm and relentless, respite from the hustle while taking it all in.

    We're in Lima for another week, and I already know I will miss it.
