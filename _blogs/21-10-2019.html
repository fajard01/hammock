    Hello from Peru! <br /> <br />
    It's Sunday and we've been here two weeks! Haven't noticed the days go by as we float from place to place, meal to meal, just enjoying the views.<br />It is a different life here as J keeps pointing out, but not one we took much getting used to.

    We're living on top of this ground-floor-shopping-centre-mini-arcade-thing (J is into 'microbusinesses') meaning there's always people downstairs selling and buying and fixing and working.<br> Also hammering. Too mich hammering. <br>Justino built
    the house several stories up though, and despite the bustle beneath our floor is wide open and very comfortable and hAS A DANCEFLOOR. <br>Yes life is complete G and I have ourselves our very own ballroom and have already baffled and amused the
    men of the
    house with our incessant dancing. <br>Nos encanta bailar!
    <br><br>
    <small>( the only difficult thing that I don't think I can become accustomed to is the lack of drinkable tap water, <br>and worse the lack of ANY water when it sometimes runs out in the evening. <br>Never in my life have I been so thrilled about
      clean socks and a shower the morning after a waterless night )

    Getting to know Tupac is fun; already got the feeling of "ahh, how nice to be home" after a long days of inner city and lima buses (almost as bad as the jubilee line - but not quite).

    We return to food on the table courtesy of our housewife
    Estik, G's quarter brother - they share the same half sister - with whom much Spanish is also practised. He does have a tendency to misunderstand so we come across as total blasphemous lunatics (the mad dancing doesn't help), but considering I
    have been learning Spanish for six weeks, and G hasn't done it since year 9, we get by decently.

    But Tupac is comfortable. <br>The madness begins when you consider J's parents bought this place 40, 50 years ago and it was on the edge of Lima. Beyond Tupac the farmlands started, but now we climb the turret on the 5th floor and there is just
    city, sprawling, stretching, melting into the mist. An ocean of dust with no horizon in every direction, it's waves crested with little Jesuses surfing the masses below. <br>Poring over maps one may think Lima has almost the same size as London,
    but it is <br>
    So. Much. Bigger.

    The new revelation was the view from the roof of J's other flat in chorrillos, which we've been helping do up. The flat is on the top floor with a ladder that leads up to the tallest roof around, and nothing compares to the exhilaration of
    standing
    above this mess of a city, wind in hair, in arms reach of the swooping birds of prey that swirl like guardian angels watching over lima. <br>It feels both calm and relentless, respite from the hustle while taking it all in.

    We're in Lima for another week, and I already know I will miss it.
