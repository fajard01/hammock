    <strong>Boo hope all is well </strong><br><br>

    In an hour we head to the jungle, the depths of the Amazon rainforest to look after a German lady's chickens, and I really need to stop doing these updates right before we go somewhere new. <br><br>

    Since Trujillo we had a few days in Lima of which neither of us remember literally anything <em>(serious memory questionmark???)</em> <br><br> It's all blank and confusing, except what we did do involved wearing heels and ties and being fancy,
    going to the launch
    of
    the new 1 sol coin at the Bank of England, no, wait, Peru, and to the Ascots, wait, no, to the Lima version of the ascots which apparently doesn't involve wearing big hats. <br><br> Or any hats.

    In essence, we've gone from white middle class in England to white upper class in Peru. We are so okay with this. <br><br> People at the Coin Launch Cocktail Party included the head of the Banco Central de Reserva del Peru and the
    Minister for the
    Environment (because this is a frog coin yay) and we were mistaken for employees of both of these. Despite G eating three times the legal limit of cocktail party snack food.

    Had a week in the lovely Huaraz, 'Switzerland of Peru' surrounded by
    mountains we couldn't really see for most of the time. J came for the first bit, nightbussing it from Lima and then almost immediately jumping on a tour to Chavín de Huántar which involved driving over a pass at 4200m and <em>(coming from
      sea
      level to this altitude in 10 hours)</em> blending our brains into soup.

    We effectively slung our heads into centrifuges. Brutal. Thank God for coca leaves, as much a national staple as ceviche, and (to freak you parents out)the source of cocaine.

    No stress, we weren't out to get high, because we were already higher than we've ever been before and chewing coca helps the body against altitude sickness and also tastes surprisingly good <cite>(nothing compares to J's suggested method though,
      to
      take a shot of pisco every 10 mins. Not sure whether that actually helps against altitude or just makes you too drunk to notice).</cite> <br><br>

    Chavín de Huántar is one of the earliest sites in Peru, buried in the mountains and featuring lots
    of
    incredible
    stone carvings, but the coolest thing by far are the subterranean stone mazes and galleries used by priests in conjunction with hallucinogenics to scare people onto believing their religion. Along with conch shells for sounds and
    reflective
    minerals for strobe light effects, I now argue that 3000 years ago, Peruvians invented the haunted house. Bam.

    Had a few chill days with J going to hot baths and museums and Campo Santo in Yungay, a town that was utterly buried by a
    landslide
    in 1970. The site is now a flat slope watched over by Huáscaran, Peru's highest mountain which loomed menacingly through slits in the cloud, reminding you of the power of nature.

    It's kinda become a tourist thing now, but there was an eerie

    So far we've been very surprised and also
    comforted by the large volume of Peruvian tourists at sites exploring their own country - a product of the positive nationalism that is evident in the myriad flags and 3 minute long national anthem (which we are 100% gonna learn)
    throughout
    the land. <br><br> There is a government push to incentivise Peruvians to travel within Peru which I think is great, and naturally living and travelling with J has afforded us many more local and peruvian experiences. This was our first
    time really
    hanging out with so many travellers, most of whom had seen half the world or at least south america on whistlestop tours of all the 'must-see' sites. It was super fun talking to everyone from all sorts of countries, but something about
    the 'traveller' attitude left a bad taste in our mouths. They seemed downright shocked to hear we're staying in just one country for six months , as if it's normal to run from checkpoint to checkpoint with only photos to remember having
    been
    there because everything is a blur. <br><br> Obviously we are not exempt from this, we've done a lot of tourist things and are taking multiple domestic and international flights and quite literally flying to the other
    But
    we've been learning so much about Peru, its culture and its history, talking to the people and getting to know it's idiosyncrasies. The more we learn, the more we want to learn, so are beyond grateful to be able to experience the country in
    such a grounded way. Don't worry, we'll (probably) still do Macchu Pichu... <br><br>Was fun to meet travellers though, and we did get two banging nights of snooker out of them at this very local pool bar whose clientele was
    exclusively
    middle aged
    Peruvian men. A bit odd being the only young/female/white people there but it helps to be with a 6ft Canadian... <br><br>Anyway, we're heading deep into the jungle for the next month, laying new roots and hopefully getting to know a new place
    with
    time. <br><br>It's <em>veeeery</em> rural so our trap phone numbers are: +51 950 157 924 +51 948 621 537 <br><br>Not sure what wifi situation will be, so we wish you all a lovely cold autumn for the foreseeable future while we drown in tropical
    rain.
