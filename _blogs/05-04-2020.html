      Life n death - 24 hours of hell - the langoliers - the north-south divide - tupac - tuuuuuuppaaaaaaac -</strong>

    So, where were we? <br><br>Ah yes, sitting deep in the mountains with my cow skull and without a care in the world, gearing ourselves up for the virus news when we finally reached civilisation again.

    The last day of the trek was fittingly
    gorgeous and I
    sneaked in a sneaky dip in the river before reaching the final stop around 10am. The bird-life was out in full force, think <em>(think!)</em> I saw a condor up high. Also crossed paths with an enormous tarantula, and, initial freak-out aside,
    behaved in a
    collected and calm manner to observe the creature until it disappeared. <br><br> <strong>Progress!</strong> <br><br>

    That was, for the coming time, our last slice of bliss. <br><br>The moment we reached the checkpoint, phones were whipped out, data switched on and........... <br><br>yep the world was on fire, what else new? <br><br>We knew the situation was bad
    internationally, and
    seems
    the Peruvian president knew it too because in the intervening time he'd announced not only the full closure of borders to Peruvians and to foreigners, effectively trapping us in the country, but to aid that, the shutdown of all airports AND -
    here
    the real kick in the nuts - banned the movement of all people within the country too. This was announced Sunday, giving people one day (Monday 16th) to get out the country and to travel between cities (and indeed within them) with the military
    moving
    in Monday night. <br><br>

    The great thing about being in Peru for the whole development of the virus was that it was so far removed from everything. <br><br>G and I first heard about it in January in cusco,

    but it was this little thing circulating China about as far from
    south
    America as you can get . <br><br>It was mentioned in the news, including this beaoutiful newspaper cover image of a Chinese dragon in a face mask with its claws wrapped around the earth, but aside from my dad not being able to talk about
    <strong>ANYTHING</strong>
    else on
    the
    phone <em>(for which I even chastised him greatly)</em> we didn't expect it to disrupt our trip much. <br><br>

    We lived in cocky ignorance and fuck yeah was it nice. We watched in detached horror as the disease took Italy, then Spain, slaughtering its way across
    europe like Genghis Khan's army, creeping towards Britain and indeed towards us. <br><br>Then, beginning of March, it finally breached the Atlantic and landed in Brazil, the invisible twin to the conquistadors 500 years earlier, yet we had only
    an
    inkling of
    how quickly it would spread. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    So there we were, Monday morning, sitting in a tiny town in the mountains while everything collapsed around us. <br><br>Had a nightmare 24hrs getting back to lima: 3hrs on a bumpy bus back to the town of Huaraz, trying to find a bus, any bus, to
    take us
    back
    to lima after everyone's initial tickets got cancelled. <br><br>The streets of Huaraz were eerily quiet and empty, something that just doesn't happen in Peru - everyone is always out on the street trying to sell you something, but suddenly
    shopfronts
    were
    closed and cars no longer driving on the roads. I was sorely, sorely tempted to stay in Huaraz for the 15-day quarantine, hanging out in the hostel with all these other tourists; even if we couldn't go out the views of the mountains would make it
    ok. <br><br>
    There was even this very sweet cherub who straight up propositioned me in the hallway, because when the world is ending you might as well go for it, no? <br><br>I mean I didn't, but it's nice to know some things carry on like normal. <br><br>So
    yeah, I
    didn't
    want
    to return to the dust and heat of lima, the claustrophobia of the <em>(admittedly big)</em> house, whose only redeeming quality is the proximity to the now-inaccessible beach. <br><br>But the smart choice was to return, try to catch the first
    flight out,
    which
    seemed
    less and less like it would be possible... <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Did manage to catch the last coach to lima with most of the group, now dubbed <em>'Team Escape Peru'</em>, carrying the frankly ridiculously enormous cow skull in my backpack <em>(with the two horns sticking out either side)</em> through multiple
    police
    checks.

    Arriving in lima in the dawning hours was eerie and unsettling, the city I now knew so well reduced to an echo of its former self. <br><br>There were still people on the streets waiting for buses but everyone looked uncomfortable and desperate to
    get
    home. <br><br>
    We were yet to see them, but we knew the military had invaded the centre of town making my journey from the bus terminal in the north to the house far in the south a rather fraught one.

    Headed to the airport with the Israelis first, in one of the few, few taxis still operational <em>(the ban on movement extended to driving)</em> to scout for any plane, but it was completely locked up, empty, lifeless, like I'd stepped into
    Stephen king's
    The
    Langoliers <em>(our new favourite story)</em>. <br><br>Though there it ends with them escaping from time-eating monsters in a plane and here it ended with us being interviewed by Peruvian newsstations and running away from the military patrol.
    <br><br>So
    then it
    was time
    to
    make my way south, bidding goodbye to the beautiful israelis who were picked up in private plans like pop stars by their government two days later anyway, and began to scout for a bus or taxi to take me home. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    I felt alright being alone since I'd become comfortable in the city, but nevertheless with the police and military everywhere there was a current of unease coursing through the streets. <br><br>Finally found a taxi to take me all the way, past
    several
    police
    blocks, army tanks and enough rifles to supply the NRA, but I made it home safe n sound n so freaking relieved, exactly 24hrs after finishing the trek. <br><br>It was so nice to see G and J and C again, though I have to say I was rather less
    enthused on
    reacquainting myself with the puppy. I just read that bit back and realised I referred to the house in tupac as 'home' at the end of the previous paragraph, that tells you everything I suppose! <br><br>

    I am so grateful to have had them all, to have been able to live there in comfortable roomy bliss for the quarantine while everyone else was cramped in hostels and 10 person dormitories in the centre of town where you were barely allowed outside.
    <br><br>
    Because here's the kicker: I really fucking enjoyed lockdown in lima. <br><br> The military presences in our area wasn't strong, we still had something resembling a market, a huge house with a roof and a view that in any situation would be
    stunning,
    enough
    space for everyone.... <br><br>And I have to say lima really stepped up for the whole lockdown thing. <br><br>It is a fact universally acknowledged that, in tupac, we won't have water from about 3pm onwards. This was a source of stress for me at
    the
    beginning
    but
    you learn to cope, storing water and just hacking the smell of the sink because you can't wash up. I liked to complain about it a lot at first, but it was only really a problem when we'd go to the beach and have to walk around like sticky sand
    monsters all evening. <br><br>Then suddenly, as soon as lockdown hit, un milagro! <br>Water all day! <br>Showers in the evening! <br>Doing dishes after dinner! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Despite being stuck here, I have to express my admiration for the Peruvian government. <br><br>After 5 months of trash-talking them, we got to experience first-hand How to Efficiently Tackle a Crisis. They knew they don't have the resources to
    handle a
    full
    scale outbreak, so instead they shut down the country; to the detriment of the economy and many people's livelihoods, to save their lives. They could've given a biiiit more notice, but I commend them for taking action when other governments
    <br><br>
    *cough* <br>
    Boris <br>*cough* <br>wouldn't. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Ok this entire letter covers about 2 days in total lol. But I do think it's important to get a flavour for how the situation is in other countries, what other governments are doing to protect their people. <br><br> Anyway. <br><br>Will write more
    soon as am doing
    literally nothing else. <br><br>Such fun. <br><br>

    Yours in safety and in health <br><br>
