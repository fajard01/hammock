Haaaaammmmmmmmoooooooooccccckk

Grrrrriiiiìiiiiiiijjjjjiiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee

Yep we got a boat down the Amazon, though first this involved the cripplingly long bus journey inland from Chiclayo to Tarapoto, followed by a taxi to Yurimaguas on what is undoubtedly the most jaw-dropping road in Peru. Winding up and through the cloud forests, great slabs of mountain blanketed in rainforest, the jungle drooping over one side of the road while the mountainside just falls away on the other. It was absolutely stunning, and I couldn't look at the landscape for any of it because I was completely and utterly carsick. Had to stare at the road the entire time we were driving through this wonderland of mountain and jungle, and G suffered the same fate until we were actively glad to be out of the mountains. Never thought i'd be saying that....

Last time, we flew both to and from Iquitos (inaccessible by road) so when Matty booked his flight to visit us here we jumped at the chance to catch the boat. Ended up on a pretty small, two-tiered transportation boat, small enough that they couldn't keep a KFC's worth of chickens on it, thank god. Then again after two nights and two days I did get serious cabin fever from the lack of space, which is ironic since nobody had cabins but just slept in the spiderweb of hammocks. The web was so dense I was sleeping on top of someone else, and you could barely walk for the sheer mass of hammocked humans in your way. Then again there was a definite thrill to this very local mode of transport, surrounded by families with 5 children (all of whom remained impressively quiet), a nun, ladies with their dogs in the hammock, one ballsy dude helping his ancient mother-in-law while wearing a pornstar t-shirt, and all these Peruvians to whom we served as on-board entertainment for the whole trip. There were a handful of other tourists too who we ended up hanging out with for the week, two Aussies chantelle and Angus the prophet-without-a-mission, Norman the lovely sweet Belgian and another german, Fabian the drug-and-family enthusiast.

It was very hot on the boat, and very sticky, not helped by already being covered in grime from the night bus, and soon we were no longer sad about not being on the boat for longer... My romantic idea of dangling in my hammock on the water for days on end was tempered by the extreme heat, lack of hygiene and lack of water until I felt stickier than if you'd bathed me in juice. But it was all worth it for that Boat Feeling, out on the wide river playing host to a dazzling light show at sunset, and then the emergence of a starry sky like no other. The tapestry of light just kept getting brighter against the vanta$black of the unpolluted sky, and it's a very weird feeling to be moving and turning on a boat while staring up, kinda like a personal planetarium display. Incredible.

Arrived in iquitos in the evening, happy to be back in the polluted tropical air and looking forward to actually spending some time in the city this time :) . After showering enough to remove three layers of skin we picked up Matty at the airport with his requested sign (cut out of toilet paper - what a diva). Grabbed some midnight dinner and suddenly tragedy struck - an hour after arriving, mattys fanny pack containing all his credit cards, cash and hearing aid batteries (!) was snatched clean off the table by a dude who leapt onto a motorbike and was off into the night. What a welcome to Peru. G and I haven't encountered anything of the sort in all our 5 months here so we were in shock too, and it did put a damper on the night though Matty took it remarkable well.

Took a chill day the next day, heading to an lake warmer than most of my baths, and though we couldn't swim far out into the lake we were quite glad for the net surrounding the designated bathing area after glimpsing the paiche, a prehistoric sea monster of a fish large enough to inspire a thousand legends, in the adjacent animal reserve. On the bus back we were taken rather by surprise when a water balloon came sailing in through the bus window, exploding in Gemmas face, though what was more surprising was the utter lack of reaction from anybody in the bus even though half the passengers got soaked. It took a second shower for us to clock there must be something going on, which we later found out was Carnaval!!! from Peruvian Nacho Libre, our friend who works at the nice hotel. Perfect timing Matty, we had no idea this water-fight tupperware festival (yes it's as random as it sounds) was taking place this weekend.

Got rather sloshed on round after round of beer with our hotel friend before going out with the guys from the boat for a night of dancing and being covered in flour (carnaval tradition), which required a day of Pool afterwards to recover before real carnaval night on Sunday. The smaller, odder sibling to rio's carnaval, the day was spent avoiding buckets of water, paint, clay or if you're unlucky worse things, being hurled at tricycles by entire families set up outside their homes with paddling pools and lots of buckets. What a tremendous family activity. The main fiestas take place around huge trees, strung full of balloons and Tupperware and erected around town to be ceremonially cut down at the end of the night. We hit one such street party, devoid of any belongings because everyone got so repeatedly soaked and covered in paint one could have irrigated a small farm with the amount of water thrown. At the cutting of the tree, I was even fast enough to nab an orange plastic bowl, which I promptly broke. :(

The rest of the night was spent in pursuit of music and dancing, until once again everyone was completely fucked the next morning though the three of us did manage a jaunt to Belén Market to ogle the dead crocodiles and armadillos. And then finally it was off on our jungle tour! Four days, the whole boat crew, off into the jungle to spot some wildlife. Spent the first two nights in stilted wooden shacks on the riverside a few hours from iquitos, comfortable but with some obvious design flaws in regards to mosquito-proofing: why take care to seal every edge of mosquito net when you leave a massive freaking gap across one side of the room?!? Also, the toilet may have been en-suite but was left utterly at the mercy of the mosquitos, so on every extended trip to the loo you stayed thoroughly entertained trying to keep the little buggers off your bare bum.

Alternately trekking through the jungle (getting rather lost) or skimming the waterways in the canoe, both by day and night (when the caimans come out ~ oooh spooky), we got to see so much wildlife, so much, so here's an abridged rundown:

Pink river dolphins which look about as similar to normal dolphins as sausage dogs do to greyhounds; canopies crawling with capuchins; all manner of birdlife from humble little woodpeckers to the imposing glare of osprey hawks and red-headed vultures; kingfishers the size (and shape) of rugby balls; one enormous snake; so many more monkeys from giant red woolleys to the tiny night monkey keeping watch in his tree hole; sloths; scarlett macaws like Chinese dragons unfurling into an explosion of colour; a scampering iguana; many a mozzie;
the unsettling glint of caiman eyes in the night; then, the rather less mysterious, more stomach-churning corpses of caimans hunted by the locals, slit open in extravagant fashion for yours truly........ and one very cheeky spider monkey who boarded our boat and then wouldn't let go of Angus's thigh without crying us a river (who also kissed my knee! I fell in love on the spot, the creature had eyes you could tumble into).

So yes our time in the jungle was hugely rewarding, not just for the animals but for being enveloped again in those towering trees, everything a surreal shade of green. Walking, I had the perpetual feeling of being inside a nature documentary but being somehow glued to the ground - I craved to soar over the canopy, ascend through the leaves like a camera can. I suppose this is the feeling of snorkelling once you learn the joy of diving, because it was still immensely enjoyable, just trudging through the jungle, a spectator to mother nature.

Even got to taste the suri, not the mini ostrich but the local delicacy that is the larvae of the palm weevil like a huge pale maggot the size of my little finger. Served grilled in the market, they are apparently edible raw - and more importantly, aliiiive - so papa to make you proud I tried this thing!!!! I felt like simba in the lion king gulping down the huge grubs, except you're meant to bite down on them as quickly as possible and they explode into juice in your mouth. The taste wasn't anything strong, but GOD the bursting bug felt horrendous, a rather less appetizing popping boba in the world's worst bubble tea. Hope I did you proud paps.

On the third evening we headed up the river to a network of lakes beautiful enough to trick you into into believing the natural world remains perfect; alternately embellished with greener-than-green plant life or completely unblemished, chic mirrors reflecting the frowning boughs of the forest. Here we pitched camp, before fishing for piranhas (gem caught one! It's freakishly hard they are very good at chomping the bait clean off the hook) and then taking the most luxurious sunset swim in those same piranha-and-caiman waters. It was glorious! Though after a few days of crippling heat and sitting on wooden benches until the boys practically eroded their arse bones, I wasn't salty about heading back to the city. And yes the mozzies were on extra top form, though we were fortunate to be with Norman such a tasty belgian who attracted the brunt of the swarms and left the jungle with more bite than plain skin...

Back in iquitos everyone was pretty run down though all still went out, except me who indulged in a proper good long nights sleep, and then we bid goodbye to the boat crew which was honestly really sad because it's the longest we've gotten to hang out with people properly. Like always being on the move is great, but people flit in and out of your life without you ever getting to make the most of new friendships. So then we were three, and headed back to the jungle house from last time for a few chill days of Hammock Time. After a pulse-raising bus ride in which the bus we were on tried to catch up with the bus we were meant to be on down a few kilometres of cluttered iquitos road, it was so nice and comforting to walk the long (long, long) path back to the house. We found the house rather packed with people and also set up much more nicely than we managed in a month of living there (sheepish glance) but it was exactly what I needed to relax, drifting in and out of sleep for a whole day and only getting out of the hammock about 3 times to eat and piss. Absolute luxury.

Another improvement was the complete lack of a) cockroaches and b) mosquitos, meaning we could spend the entire day dawn til dusk outside in the forest without getting bitten once! Last time we tried super hard but always had to concede to the Might of the Mosquito barely an hour after going outside, so I have no idea why they suddenly fucked off. It was wonderful though, lying undressed on the forest floor watching the breeze tease the treetops, eating cacao pods (new fave froot) straight off the tree and listening to the familiar sounds of the jungle when Matty didn't have music on his speaker. Oh god I have missed listening to normal music that isn't reggaeton or cumbia thank you so much Matty.

Unfortunately only had a few days to indulge in the languid Eden of the house, because on our last day we had to hit the pool at the same hotel from before because pooool. Tragedy struck again though when, night having fallen, a bat crashed into my forehead and then clung onto Gemmas arm so I tried to grab her phone to look at it and accidentally elbowed it into the pool. Shit! It's bad, very bad, but i suppose it was time for me to break someone else's phone seeing as I've broken enough of my own. Sorry gemma. Good timing though, as phone went home with Matty while we flew back to the dry summer heat of lima.

So, that's goodbye iquitos, place we've spent the most time apart from lima and I'm very glad it is so because I love this mad city with it's crazy markets and thick air and armies of tricycles. The tricycle thing is such a luxury, don't think we walked anywhere this time, not when it's so cheap (3 soles) just to jump in a mototaxi that'll take you right to the door or wherever you're going. We probably got 6 or 7 a day, and even more on nights out because it's so easy!!! And I'm glad we had so much jungle time, the constant symphony lulling us to sleep while eagles soar overhead. But, I'm ready to go. Am yearning for the Andes again, to be up high in the barren wilderness with the wind whipping round my legs. I've got horizontigo, and after over a month in broiling heat I've completely forgotten what it feels like to be cold. So, Amazon, you've served us excellently and I've loved every minute, but it's time I get back to my mountains.

Forever an Amazonian,

Mereida
