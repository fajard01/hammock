    Hey! <br><br>Hope everyone is holding up alright, our entire reality has changed since I last wrote. <br><br>*Current status* quarantined safely in lima, been in full military lockdown for two weeks so just sitting tight waiting for the UK
    government to haul ass
    over here and come get us. <br><br>Enjoying sun and what beer there is left in the city.
    <br><br>
    But here's a distraction from the constant parliamentary updates and corona memes - My last week on the road in Peru! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>



    The breaking of the fellowship - attack of the dogs - laguna cheerup - a farewell to arms(trength) - Santa cruise - it's fucking cold - paramount pictures - let's play pandemic <br><br>


    Yep after 5 months travelling with gemma in what I have to say has been a very fitting and productive partnership, it was finally time to start my solo career! <br><br>Not that it was creative differences that split the band, I'm just not used to
    being
    around humans so consisistently for so long and honestly I'm impressed by how long we both lasted. But the last couple of weeks hanging out with so many people begun to take their toll, so immediately after arriving back in Lima I set off again
    in
    pursuit of mountains. <bg>
      <bg></bg>
    </bg>I just wanted to get away, mostly from the puppy that's taken residence in J's house who has a tendency to regard mereidas belongings (and toes!) as her own banquet and CHEWS ALL MY STUFF. <br><br>If I wanted all my shit to be
    chewed
    I'd bloody well do it myself. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Headed first to huanuco, a classic central Andean city with not much to offer me but a pile of rocks claiming to be an ancient temple and the nicest taxi driver money could buy (if not the most intact vehicle).

    From here I quickly moved
    on to La
    Union, a teeny town with better mountain access an eventful colectivo ride away from huanuco. <br><br>Colectivos are informal public transport, shared taxis that plough the smaller transit routes usually stuffed full of passengers and stacked
    high with
    bits
    n bobs that they force you into to fill up and start driving. One dude practically lifted me out of one taxi through the window to throw me into the colectivo. <br><br>What gentlemen.

    Felt good to finally be travelling alone - there's a comfort and ease to travelling together, and a pure joy in sharing profound and beautiful experiences with someone you love, never having to explain anything and often moving in symbiosis or as
    a
    single organism, but I felt so ready to go it alone. <br><br>Met so many other tourists who really enjoyed travelling alone, and though i wouldn't have been able to do it at the beginning of the trip I now feel at home in Peru and in the
    traveller
    lifestyle,
    refreshed to be starting my own adventure. <br><br>La union turned out to be a rather unremarkable, completely untouristy town which suited my needs perfectly, avoiding speaking English for a good 3 days and blending in to the local populace as
    much as
    my
    uncatholic clothes would allow. <br><br>

    On my second day alone I headed up the mountain path to huanuco pampa, the incan ruins on top of the plains above la union. <br><br>Well that was the plan, as I hit the deserted trail with the mountain all to myself for a lung-pummeling first
    acclimatisation
    hike in preparation for my upcoming trek. <br><br>Felt good to have the mountain to myself, save for the odd llama farmer (stay calmer if you want to harm a llama call a llama farmer) but the exhilaration of reaching the plain was short lived
    when I was
    suddenly attacked by three stray dogs. <br><br>They came out of nowhere, and being a flat plain there was nowhere to go. This happens a lot in Peru, aggressive gangs of strays, but they usually back off if you stand up to them. It helps being in
    a group,
    so
    I was pretty angry this occurred on my first trip out alone! <br><br>It was terrifying, the dogs surrounding me growling and jabbing at me and I couldn't face all three until two went straight for my legs, taking one each in their jaws .
    <br><br>By this
    point I
    was
    screaming and crying, legs burning and bleeding and not a soul around. <br><br> Sorry but in some situations mountains just aren't enough. <br><br> Eventually a little girl turned up, called off the dogs in an unreassuringly apathetic tone and
    was
    absolutely no
    help
    to my plight. <br><br>Legged it down the mountain in tears into the arms of the teeny tiniest old lady who tried to wash the wounds and took me to a pharmacy.

    So yeah I didn't make it to Huanuco Viejo, instead I made it to the hospital, just a shack really, but it was an adventure. <br><br>Currently working on not being scared of dogs, and decided to move on quickly the next day to Huaraz. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>When i
    arrived in
    thr
    bus, I realised with a slightly sinking heart that it was still clouds galore (the motive behind coming as late as possible in the trip was to avoid view blockages like clouds) but what a galore it was: even Turner would have had a mission
    painting
    the metropolis of clouds stacked in the valleys and up the slopes, towers and palaces in brilliant white against the bright blue. <br><br>Huaraz had been slightly disappointing when we came in autumn, but I surprised myself with how happy I was
    to be
    back,
    watching the sunset burn across the sky from our rooftop kitchen. Everyone in the hostel was lovely and I felt in a truly happy place to be back :)

    Next day, first hike was up 4500m to the stunning Laguna Churup, just one of the many cosmic blue glacial lakes polkadotting the Cordillera Blanca. <br><br>Was fortunate to meet a superb hiking partner in the colectivo up, a mad french canadian
    from the
    gun-toting backwoods of quebec named oliver who pushed me up the steep path in an acclimatisation sprint that transformed my lungs into prunes. <br><br>Rewarded myself with an invigorating swim at the top that threatened to turn me into an
    amputee, but I
    couldn't resist the pull of the icy azul water!

    The following day I embarked on some proper climbing with a local guide to give the thighs a break. <br><br>Been constantly fantasizing about hitting the walls since enveloping myself in the Andes, but one warm-up climb quickly reminded me why I
    tend to
    hike
    up mountains instead of climbing straight up the rock faces. <br><br>The strength drained out of my arms as blood from a haemophiliac and the gritty rock proved a sharp (!) contrast to the positively soft hand holds you get on a sport wall so I
    came away
    from the rock peeling skin off my hands like latex gloves. <br><br>But it was exhilarating, cresting the top of the walls in triumph (cheated quite a bit on the way up...) only to be rewarded with the most jaw-dropping views across the valley to
    the
    Cordillera Blanca's snow-frosted peaks winking in the morning sun.
    <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>
    Was thoroughly deaded after climbing, more utterly exhausted than I felt in a long time so much it hurt even just to lie still. <br><br> Nevertheless managed to schlep my corpse to the internet cafe, a cesspool of sweat and testosterone where
    young males
    congregate to generate dopamine by shooting at each other. It's also pitch $black, so I oriented myself by the glow of video games to a computer where I could edit a comic submission, soundtracked by urban grunts telegraphing the successes and
    losses
    dotted around the room. <br><br>It was less stressful than that may sound. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    For my final acclimatisation hike I did the revered Laguna 69 that everyone in Huaraz doesn't shut up about.

    The lake itself is not THAT stunning (though by general global standards still a knockout- I'm just a lil bit spoilt here) but with views
    across the Nevado Huáscaran (Peru's highest mountain) and the surrounding landscape enough to stop you in your tracks.

    This happened frequently on the hike up so I kept holding up the people behind to stop and admire Middle Earth despite the
    descending clouds. <br><br>Ended up hanging out at the lake with some other hikers for a few hours, waiting juuuuust long enough for the clouds to lift and unveil the surrounding glaciers dropping into the lake before the sunny descent back down.

    Worth
    it!

    And then.... trek time!!! <br><br>Finally embarked on the Santa Cruz trek which was the plan since our first jaunt to Huaraz in November. G was meant to join me but was blissfully happy to be on my own too, and got thrown in with a banging group
    for 3
    freezing nights and four glorious days. <br><br>The walking wasn't particularly demanding, but despite having acclimatised and not having to carry heavy bags, the altitudes made sure we were all breathing hard and getting a proper workout.
    <br><br>

    Began the trek at about 3600, though not before one of the locals in the village informed us the borders were closing on Monday (it was Friday, but we didn't know how serious the rumour would turn out to be...). The walk took us through a quaint
    emerald valley, weaving in and out of the shadows of dramatic peaks looming above the clouds.

    The first camp was pitched on a marsh which just screamed of bad planning but in fairness the view was gorgeous, we caught the last of the afternoon sun
    and
    only one member of the group actually put their foot in it. <br><br>The is the first trek I've done here (or I think ever in the mountains!) where it's full-blooded camping, not just huts or something, which excited me but also terrified because
    I know
    myself and I do NOT sleep well in a tent. <br><br>I just don't, I always need to pee in the middle of the night regardless of how little I've drunk or how much I've already pissed. <br><br>Tent-Induced Incontinence, it's a real disorder, might

    The next day we ascended the Punta Union pass, touted as the toughest part of the trek with the best view. <br><br>Set off in the early morning mist which somehow never got it together to fuck off.... <br><br>I'm telling you, it's a lot less
    rewarding to climb
    all
    the way up to 4800 with no view, praying the clouds will shift when you reach the top, wheezing and dragging yourself up the slabs or rock imagining the sun breaking through just as you crest the... <br><br>

    Enjoyed it regardless and settled down on the plain below the pass for our second camping spot, wrapped in a 360 panorama of snow-frosted, razor-sharp peaks. <br><br>As evening wore on they
    emerged like forest nymphs at twilight, until night fell to a $black sky illuminated by the snow reflecting the starlight. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    It was only these silver peaks in the night that managed to yank me out of bed to piss, because BOY was it cold. <br><br>The first night was cold for sure but here we were higher again (4200) and I obviously missed a trick when packing in lima
    where it
    is
    currently WARM and SUNNY and good Lord I forgot what it feels like to be really, truly, bone-chillingly, fertility-destroyingly cold. <br><br> Suffice to say sleep was not on the menu that night, so it's great the next day was by far the longest
    and most
    exhausting! <br><br>Yay! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    Really though, day 3 was breathtaking from start to finish, and not just because of the altitude. We detoured to a cobalt glacial lake under Alpamayo, perched high in its little dip and screened all round by sheer rock walls with a huge freaking
    glacier right in front of us just dropping into the water. Couldn't resist a swim in the early sunlight, and we had a good long time just to bask and pose precariously and sing happy birthday in 6 or 7 languages before the long and dusty descent
    watched over by the perfect cone of the paramount pictures mountain.

    Just a dreamy day, running down the mountain and traipsing for hours through the valley over the dried lake bed, the colours changing from white to blue to green to golden
    brown,
    slowly darkening as we progressed through the valley. <br><br>The icy peaks didn't cease either, though we never did glimpse the eponymous Santa Cruz..... <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    It felt so good to walk alone, indulging my own thoughts and languishing in the pleasant emptiness of my head. <br><br>Fortunately or unfortunately, I found a beautiful intact and well-preserved cow skull which of course I had to bring home for
    Gemma
    because
    it's pristine and glorious and Heavy As Shit, nearly ripped my arms out of their sockets tryna carry that thing down the mountain. Did grow a bit attached though, he's named Joseph and slept in my tent much to the chagrin of my tentmate...
    <br><br>after
    8
    hrs of walking I was rather deaded and slept like a milked-up baby :) finally. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    The views and the walking were pretty exhilarating, but best bit was almost sitting in the big tent in the evenings with everyone, warding off the cold with stories and jokes and coronavirus conspiracy theories. <br><br>I love getting to know
    people from
    such varied backgrounds - obviously we all come from lifestyles with enough wealth to travel for leisure, but here we were, 8 people 5 countries 3 ex-military (Israeli and korean armies!) and 1 rabid cheese-lover. Hint: not me. <br><br>It was a
    luxury to
    spend the days of the virus escalation in blissful mountainous ignorance, with this wonderful group joking our way through the uncertainty.
    <br><br>
    I think I'll leave it at that, we've heard and thought and talked enough about the virus for now. <br><br>I leave you, hunched in a tent surrounded by cows and rugged peaks, warming our hands by the light of a single candle. <br><br>
