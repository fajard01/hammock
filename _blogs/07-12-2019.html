Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaattttt

Boat 

Was tempted to make the whole newsletter just boat because yay we went on a boat and I have misssed boats 

But life in the jungle is good there is rain and mosquitos but apart from fighting off ant infestations and playing tug of war with tarantulas (Gemma Exclusive, that) life is relaxed and chill and we now have three hammocks courtesy of all the Germans living in the house. Three Germans! Gonna take over the Amazon

Boat this morning to see tapier and monkeys and jaguar better than all the jaguar skulls and chopped up crocodiles in market

Anyway gotta dash the light situation is still unideal but enjoying the sun

Byeeee
