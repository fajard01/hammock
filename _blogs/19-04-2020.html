    The Great Peruvian Rescue Mission: <br><br>

    A story of intrigue, suspense and solidarity, involving: five aeroplanes; a race across the city; one daily mail reporter; some angry emails; and lots and lots of waiting! <br><br>


    Woop woop we made it back to London! Three weeks ago, but the sentiments still ring true. Not that I had a problem being stuck in lima, I just didn't want to be stuck there indefinitely. <br><br>The initial shutdown was only two weeks, but just
    like
    everywhere else it's been extended and extended and I'd rather be stuck at home in London for 3 months than lima. <br><br>Despite the abundance of vegetables and national anthems. <br><br>Our initial flight home, booked before even coming to
    Peru, was
    exactly a
    week
    after lockdown began. <br><br>Ugh! So close to being such perfect timing! <br><br>Still I can't complain, I was ready to come home, I know heaps and heaps of people who still had so much travel planned or who'd only just begun their trip.
    <br><br>We were
    in Peru half a
    year, got so immensely lucky it only hit at the end! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    So the mission was to try and get home, but the first week or so was pretty fruitless as all commercial flights were completely stopped and the British government were being NO HELP thanks a LOT guys great time to SHUT the British embassy in
    Lima. <b><br></b>
    Excellent diplomacing there. <br><br>I wasn't panicked, I was remarkably calm which by my standards isn't that hard though I'd like to point out my tendency to panic has greatly diminished over this trip. Thanks gemma. <br><br>We were damn lucky
    to live
    with
    Justino
    and both have dual nationality, so my hopes were mostly pinned on the Germans who were so predictably organised we'd all been registered and guaranteed repatriation before the Brits even acknowledged our existence. <br><br>

    Nevertheless I kept up to date with the Brits ina WhatsApp chat for everyone stuck in peru who worked exceptionally hard in lobbying the government and shouting at the top of their voices since Raab seemed rather disinterested. <br><br>In
    fairness
    everyone
    had a lot on their plate and bigger problems of an unprecedented nature, there wasn't a manual to follow (though since the government runs on precedent instead of constitution surely they should be used to it...?). <br><br>Even the Peruvians were
    cooperative
    and on-board when it came to repatriation. <br><br>But the brits were as helpful as butter knives to vulnerable people trapped, people who had absolutely no chance to get out the country because of Peru's short notice, and there weren't as many
    Brits in
    Peru
    as maybe elsewhere (about 1000, compared to 4000 Germans - good Lord no wonder we couldn't escape them) but how would they know if they didn't bother to find out. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    The WhatsApp group was incredible though - I was in one for Germans as well, who after being registered and told to hold tight by their embassy proceeded to do nothing but moan and bitch about the apparent 'lack of action'. <br><br>Instead, the
    Brits,
    who
    saw the government do absolutely shit all, banded together to launch an attack with an artillery of press interviews, petitions, strongly worded emails and the h-bomb that is Twitter.

    Not only did I first-hand experience the power of the press <br><br>
    <em>(lookin' at u, Daily Mail wink wink) (ok so they took all the worst bits from my interview but THEY USED OUR STUPID PHOTO FROM MACHU PICCHU! Famous and looking like a gay couple, I love the Mail)</em>

    but what made me happiest was seeing all these
    people
    who'd probably never interact past a polite British hello in normal circumstances work together, support each other and work so hard to get each other home. <br><br>The British government certainly left much to be desired, but these almost
    anonymous
    Brits
    made me proud to be British. And we never even met most of them! <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>

    I didn't have a problem with drifting from day to day once the government got their shit together and I knew we'd be going home at some point, just savouring the sticky lima moments and unadulterated creativity that comes from deep boredom.
    <br><br>There
    was
    a lot of hopes being raised before quickly being dashed to the floor like a subpar wrestler whenever there were whispers of a plane, but it was only the governments complete lack of communication that rubbed me up the wrong way. <br><br>Shouldn't
    have to
    get
    our news from Twitter, or other countries' embassies, or inside men at BA.... <br><br><em>(I can link you to an eloquently angry email I wrote to Emily Thornberry rather than bore you here, boy do I write well when I'm angry).</em> <br><br>
    <hr> <br><br> It
    was still quarantined bliss
    until they announced the LAST planes going to london and suddenly for two days It was STRESS. <br><br>Well for me, G stayed unperturbed, but then again she didn't have to check her phone every hour in case they sent an email only giving us one
    hour to
    reply,
    as they did with the first plane. <br><br>Grrrrrrrr. <br><br>Anyway, we weren't put on either flight on Saturday, so for good measure I emailed the FCO a few more times begging them to put us on a plane (dignity went out the window but not
    politeness - think I
    wrote
    Please about 11 times). <br><br>Sunday night the holy email arrived - we were going home!! <br><br>Except the email wasn't holy at all, no it was rather more satanic, as I quote <br><br>

    <cite>
      "Tomorrow is the last planned UK flight. <br>Please make all efforts to turn up the airport if you wish to leave the country, but please note that spaces on the flight are limited."
    </cite> <br><br>
    I will never forgive the FCO for that email, blame any high blood pressure I may develop later in life on this. <br><br>Surprised I slept at all that night. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>


    Then, the fateful day: all clothes and books and brig-a-brac, dried llamas, two hammocks, a ginormous cow skull packed up, Justino drove us across the city one last time with his special 'I'm-friends-with-the-cops' driving permit, where
    incidentally
    I change my answer to Best Road in Peru. <br><br>It might've been the sentimentality, the prospect of leaving, but my breathe was stolen by the view from the highway El Alto across boxy houses, that classic lima architecture, the slums creeping
    up the
    mountains in the morning mist. <br><br>Lima, te amo. <br><br>

    Once we arrived at the queue at 6am, it was endgame and I could relax once more. <br><br>Again, I'm surprised at my own capacity for calmness, but in the *does maths, is mildly horrified* 11 hours of queuing and waiting, not once was I stressed.
    <br><br>
    Success! <br><br>
    Enjoyed chatting to Brits again more than expected, the FCO staff were lovely and helpful and kept us up to speed on everything (doesnt make up for previous lack of communication, but highly appreciated) and wow BA planes are really classy.
    <br><br>
    Didn't
    even have to go through security! It was just a sniffer dog who was more interested in people's lunches. So essentially we traded a 30 hour journey via toronto which apparently has nothing except snow cones for a luxury flight into Gatwick with
    (appropriate, but ONLY here never elsewhere) Plane Clapping and free loo roll they handed out at the end. <br><br>Not complaining. <br><br>

    Yes, we made it back, they didn't stop the cow skull in G's suitcase, and suddenly we were walking though quiet empty COLD England and already it feels like we never left at all. <br><br>I enjoyed lima lockdown frankly far too much, but with all
    the
    excitement and melodrama of trying to get home it never properly hit me we were leaving Peru. <br><br>There was no bittersweet ending, no wistful tears, no chest-piercing over-the-shoulder glance. Now we're home and the memories are already
    slipping
    through
    my fingers all the time, I try to capture every minute, the feeling in it, can I just copy and paste abba lyrics here they can say it better than me. <br><br>Furthermore, with this country now locked down too, it feels like were in limbo; having
    left
    lima
    but not arrived in london. <br><br>It's deeply weird. <br><br>

    Nevertheless I am hugely grateful to the government for finally getting their shit together, to those working for BA, to everyone on that blessed group chat who not only worked hard to 'molest' the government <em>(calm down it means annoy in
      Spanish.
      No
      moleste Jheremi!)</em> but kept our spirits up by repeatedly posting the photo of the Israeli plane... <br><br>I am glad to be home. <br><br>
    <hr><br><br>


    There will be at least one more email that is at yet unwritten looking back on the whole of Peru. 23 is an annoyingly unround number but it is prime...

    <br><br>
    Until then, from my hammock as I have been forever inducted into the hammock cult - <br><br>
