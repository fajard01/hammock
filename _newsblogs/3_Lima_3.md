Hi! Hope all is well in fair and brexit-ridden Europe. We're an hour away from heading to the airport to fly north, why must cheap flights be so ridiculously timed. We've had three weeks in lima, and while I'm so so so excited to see some more of the country, i feel ill already miss the dusty comfort of the city. We've done so much that we haven't written about so in the interests of efficiency we present: bullet points.

What we did in lima:

Swam in the Pacific which was far too cold to be allowed but we are British so it was piss easy. Got to swim up really close to gorgeous pelicans both sitting on the water and gliding over the surface between waves elegant and effervescent as Jesus, as well as very close to (and in the way of) surfers who kept falling off so were certainly not as great as Jesus. It's really hard to stay afloat in large waves when you're laughing this much.

Had the pleasure of being rushed round a beautiful colonial Franciscan monastery in the most frustratingly fast tour momey can buy. It's built on top of the skeletons of 70,000 people (who were apparently made up of only heads and thighs - thanks quicklime) (quicklime has trouble decomposing large bones but is great for getting rid of bodies - pro tip from Gem).

Cried in church

Accompanied J to all sorts of business meetings and Important People Events with politicians. Several days have now been bring your kids to work day for J - G and I are now pretty much official siblings because apparently we just look that alike? These people are all weird and confusing and not speaking Spanish doesn't help but neither does the political ambiguity that requires severe Googlage after each event to work out what's going on. Some of them have very big gold rings, which is particularly important to Gemma Who Is A Magpie.

Got lost and frustrated on the (surprisingly efficient and well-organised) bus system for three agonising hours of bad luck, only to walk out of our final station and run straight into Justino, a complete timing coincidence and about the best piece of good luck I've ever experienced.

Rode a skinny horse through the mountains

Went to possible the worst art exhibition I've seen in my life. It. Was. Painful.

Got vip'd at lima's biggest gig: Mega Mass. Thanks to J and his contacts/events/secret service status we were given front seats to this enormous service in one of the gradients cathedrals in lima while the public clamoured behind barriers and stood through many hourly masses to get to the front and receive communion from a priest flanked by a man holding a big sign saying 'comunion'. Really felt like a rock concert except the pop star was god and the groupies wore vestments.

Fell through a roof. Namely the roof of J's shopping centre from the little tower above the top floor, prompting not the expected pity but incessant laughter from the household. Hole in the roof (made of corrugated plastic - I'm not that heavy) remains but tailbone is healed enough to dance again and stop me walking like a cowboy who hasn't seen solid ground in a week.

Were consecutively dead for 4 days turning into detritus

Got angry at rats and men who wouldn't believe us about said rats. Also protected the citizens of the kingdom (mice of the house) from a small round man armed with a toilet plunger.

Taught the men of the house that yes, it is possible to eat vegetables, and yes, they really do taste that good.


Now off to the moody north for hopefully less dust and more uncomfortable bus rides.

Hasta la pr√≥xima
