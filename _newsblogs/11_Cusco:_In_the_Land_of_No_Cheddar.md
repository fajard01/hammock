Oh, right, the poison, the poison for Kuzko. The poison chosen specifically to kill Kuzko, Kuzko's poison......that poison?


Frohe Weihenachten, Happy Christmas everyone, or Happy Chris-Max as we're calling it because we have made it to cusco and we are no longer a roaming duo but have expanded the fellowship (we're also reading Lord of the rings out loud).

Yes its good to be here, not least because Chris's flat has the most maravilloso view over Cusco nestled in the surrounding mountains. Every direction you look, there's mountains tickled by clouds, rising up as sentinels over this quaint little terracotta city. We're glad to be here for Christmas- more than anywhere else we've seen so far, cusco feels real European in its cobbled streets, wood carvings and ornate wrought metal, all it needs is a lick of snow to complete the picture. In the morning sun, the tall dark trees (European again, introduced by the Spanish because no trees grown here naturally) and waves of tiled roofs could almost trick you into believing you're in the Mediterranean. There is No Such Thing as a tiled roof (or even a roof) in lima because it never ever rains, so it's a nice change.

Max arrived a day after us in a whirlwind of things we asked him to bring. Thank you max, for carrying! Thank you mums for packing!
Christmas angels. Except Max may or may not have forgotten the crucial cheddar, which led to some tempestuous rebukes from both G (2.5 months no cheddar) and C (2 years no cheddar!).

We had a solid few days of Christmas because man it is hard work feeling Christmassy when there's no family to help! We miss you guys! For Christmas eve the three of us went to midnight mass which took place at 8pm (no not because of the time difference), but it was a glorious affair in the big cathedral that you usually got to pay 30 soles to get into. It's more a museum than a church, filling its high arched walls with painting after painting and also mirrors (?), presumably to reflect your Christmas sins. We had a few of those, attending two parties with C's teacher friends which may or may not have resulted in putting me Out Of Action for the best part of Christmas day... We did succeed in finally doing an intimate Christmas for the four of us, plus C's flatmate Toby the Kiwi who pronounces eggs 'iiiicks' and uses the word 'bötch' a lot. Thank you for all the gifts and cards, they finally made it feel like Christmas!


This is just a gorgeous place, can totally see why Chris and all his English teacher mates have chosen to settle here. It doesn't take long to get up the mountains around cusco, whether to clamber about the heaps of archaeological ruins that pepper the surroundings like a ring of fire, or just to last through bone-shaking lightning storms that frequently dazzle the city like Christmas lights. We were just chilling on this viewing hill (needed a break after climbing all them stairs because man the aaaltitude it hurts) and hail came the size of mint imperials, to be replaced before long by a downpour that sounded like an infinite number of stones rolling down a river bed, and the most fantasmagoric lightning storm playing all around us. Like a firework display the lightning drew shapes in the sky above the city, and a few times it came so close to our little spot that light and sound hit us at the same time.

Even more time has been spent living out our Lord of The Rings dreams in the endless landscape of crushed velvet, choppy peaks and ruin after ruin after ruin. So many temples and stone structures sculpted into the echo of a civilisation long gone, living on in the cusqueñan outskirts as well as in the foundations of almost all the buildings in the city. (The Spanish were smart, they came along and destroyed everything incan but kept the strong foundations and just built on top of them). There's a freedom to exploring this history, constantly enveloped in the 360 views of the Andes.

Happy New year's to you all!
